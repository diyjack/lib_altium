lib_altium: Altium libraries
==========

I just figured out ways to improve the design experience with Altium and created my own design library.

source/ is the directory holding all files to generate the integrated libraries.

Some explanations
_________________
1. Altium has three kinds of library files:
1) Schematic / Capture Library: *.schlib
2) PCB Library: *.pcblib
3) Integrated Library: *.intlib

2. Integrated libraries are single portable lib files generated by library projects with schematic lib and pcb lib.
